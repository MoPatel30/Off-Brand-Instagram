# PhotoShare

Photo-sharing web-application where users can login, create profiles, and like & post to a live, universal feed. 


## About

This is a full-stack social media-like project where I was able to practice more on backend, learned authentication, and got better at React & its intricacies. 

Initially, this web-app was supposed to have a traditional backend using Mongo, Node, and Express, but complications came up with storing/retreiving images. I soon realized migrating to Firebase and making use of Firestore & Storage was my best bet. As a side effect, all of the services I used to make this web-app functional now all reside in the same place, Firebase. 


## Languages, Tools, & Services

Front-end: HTML, CSS, React, Redux, Bootstrap, MaterialUI

Back-end: Firebase Hosting + Database + Firestore + Oauth
